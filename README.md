## Abstract

This project implements *parallel sorting* using the **Bitonic Sort** algorithm and the **CUDA** framework. The primary objective is to sort a dataset of N = 2<sup>k</sup> numbers (where k is a natural number). The implementation employs parallel processing to achieve efficient sorting, making it suitable for large-scale data sets.
